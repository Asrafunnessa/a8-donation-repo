# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

###Question : Added three projects features in your Readme File.

###Answer : Three projects Features Given Below with description:-

###Components: 
JSX is the foundation for defining React components. React components are reusable building blocks for my user interface. I can define my own custom components and compose them to create complex UIs.

###Loader:
 Loader doesn't handle the loader's state or UI. Typically, i would use this loader function in a context where i can manage loading states and UI updates, such as in a React component.

 ###Custom Hooks:
  Custom hooks are functions in React that start with the word "use" (by convention) and can encapsulate state logic, side effects, or any reusable functionality that can be shared across components.
